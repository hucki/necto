üìÖ Appointment scheduling for teams in a health care environment

![](./public/Necto.png)

necto provides teams with the ability to schedule appointments with patients/clients on a weekly basis. The number of weekly appointment a team member has to fulfill can be indivdually defined. Every Appointment can be defined as in House or as a home visit.

## Project description

App to keep track of the appointments of a team of therapists, where each appointment has a defined frequency (i.e. weekly) and a number of recurrences (i.e. 10 times). The App provides an overview of appointments for the hole team, as well as personal views for each team member. Single appointments can be moved to different dates/times/therapists without necessarily affecting the rest of the recurring appointments.

## Features
